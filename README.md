# RE (raylib engine)
###### (This isn't intended to be used for anything, it was just a fun project)

An engine created in C++ using [raylib-cpp](https://github.com/RobLoach/raylib-cpp), a C++ wrapper for the [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) game development library.
Heavily based on the structure and usage of Godot Engine.
